# [DistroHooper](https://github.com/oSoWoSo/DistroHooper)
### Still Testing version!

quickly create and run VMs

 As a base fork of excellent [quickemu](https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu)

Removed:
  Windows support (Currently not intended)
  MacoOS support (Currently not intended)

I added:

## quickgui
  using yad

### .Desktop file generator
  It will simple generate .desktop files for every supported VM in quickemu.
  So you can copy it anywhere...
  
  And I mean every supported distro.
  
  you can download new distro with few clicks of a mouse
  
  You need to run quickgui just for update supported distros.

### Simple GUI using yad --notebook

See it in action on youtube...
